These folders contain the DNA and protein sequences for the list of spore coat genes used for Qin & Driks, 
2013. 
Each folder is an orthologous cluster. The genes in genomes of type strains of 11 species have been
examined by phylogeny. 

These 11 species are: Bacillus anthraces, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus clause, Bacillus halodurans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus weihenstephanensis, and Bacillus mojavensis.
