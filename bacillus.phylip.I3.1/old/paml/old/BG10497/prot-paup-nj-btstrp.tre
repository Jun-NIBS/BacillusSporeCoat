>Bootstrap method with heuristic search:
>  Number of bootstrap replicates = 100
>  Starting seed = 637135071
>  Optimality criterion = parsimony
>    Character-status summary:
>      Of 143 total characters:
>        All characters are of type 'unord'
>        All characters have equal weight
>        28 characters are constant
>        55 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
>        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 60
>    Gaps are treated as "missing"
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>  Addition sequence: simple (reference taxon = BCE33L2604 spore)
>  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
>  Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  Topological constraints not enforced
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>   100 bootstrap replicates completed
>   Time used = <1 sec (CPU time = 0.15 sec)
