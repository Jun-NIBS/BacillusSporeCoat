>Heuristic search settings:
>  Optimality criterion = likelihood
>    Likelihood settings:
>      Transition/transversion ratio = 1.70016 (kappa = 3.3190192)
>      Assumed nucleotide frequencies (empirical frequencies):
>        A=0.25169  C=0.23253  G=0.31285  T=0.20294
>      Among-site rate variation:
>        Assumed proportion of invariable sites  = none
>        Distribution of rates at variable sites = gamma (discrete approximation)
>          Shape parameter (alpha)   = 0.0136475
>          Number of rate categories = 4
>          Representation of average rate for each category = mean
>      These settings correspond to the HKY85+G model
>      Number of distinct data patterns under this model = 212
>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional iteration
>      Branch-length optimization = one-dimensional Newton-Raphson with pass limit=20, delta=1e-06
>      -ln L (unconstrained) = unavailable due to missing-data and/or ambiguities
>  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
>  Addition sequence: random
>    Number of replicates = 5
>    Starting seed = 349599864
>  Number of trees held at each step during stepwise addition = 1
>  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR)
>  Steepest descent option not in effect
>  Initial 'MaxTrees' setting = 100
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  Topological constraints not enforced
>  Trees are unrooted
>
>Heuristic search completed
>   Total number of rearrangements tried = 876
>   Score of best tree(s) found = 3814.70670
>   Number of trees retained = 1
>   Time used = 6 sec (CPU time = 6.38 sec)
