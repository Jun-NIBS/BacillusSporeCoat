in order for the scripts to run. 

Folder online.supplementary.files contain the supplementary files for Qin & Driks2013
 coat.profile.for.submission.xlsx

Folder bacillus.species.tree  contains the workfing files for 16s rDNA and 34 essential genes. 

Folder tree.test  contains the topology test using the highly conserved essential genes. 

Folder compare.profiles is the working folder for orthologous profile analysis and heatmap generatin. 

Folder key.data contains some key data used in the spore coat project. 

Folder pairwise.matrix.omega.062310 is the working folder to perform the pairwise test and generate heatmaps. 

Folder coatpaml contains the free omega runs that were excluded from the final submission to BMC Evolution. 

File genomes.tar.gz contain the genomes used in the spore coat projects. Some additional genomes were also dumped here for future studies. 

File whole.genome.codemlLRT.tar contain the working folders for whole genome LRT test.
